## How to Use

### Current Setup
Your app is now configured to use **Anthropic Claude Sonnet** by default. You'll need to:

1. Get an Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   ```

### Switching to OpenAI (if needed)
If you want to switch back to OpenAI:

```bash
npm run switch:openai
```

Your existing OpenAI API key is already configured, so this will work immediately.

### Switching Back to Anthropic
```bash
npm run switch:anthropic
```

## Environment Variables

### For Anthropic (default)
```
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  # optional, this is the default
```

### For OpenAI (alternative)
```
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # optional, this is the default
```

## Benefits

1. **Better AI Quality**: Claude Sonnet is generally considered more capable for complex reasoning
2. **Constructive Criticism**: The critic now helps strengthen ideas rather than just pointing out flaws
3. **Cost Flexibility**: Easy to switch between providers based on cost considerations
4. **Redundancy**: If one provider has issues, you can quickly switch to the other
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more providers in the future

## Next Steps

1. **Get Anthropic API Key**: Visit https://console.anthropic.com/ to get your API key
2. **Update Environment**: Add your Anthropic API key to `.env.local`
3. **Test the App**: Run `npm run dev` and test the conversation functionality
4. **Optional**: Compare responses between providers using the switching scripts

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
2. Verify the provider is set correctly (`AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` or `AI_PROVIDER=openai`)
3. Check the console for any error messages
4. Try switching providers to isolate the issue

The app maintains full backward compatibility with your existing OpenAI setup while adding the new Anthropic capabilities and improved critical thinking approach.
